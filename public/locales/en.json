Or what would happen if our planet collided with another? What if a giant solar storm hit Earth? Worse yet: what would happen after an alien invasion? We imagined all of that. And if those hypotheses weren’t enough, we still considered six other ways the world could end.\n\nThese pieces were presented as complementary content to the episodes, released day by day, Monday through Friday. During one of President Michel Temer’s speeches—after being charged by the Federal Police—the main character of the series Bull analyzed his facial expressions. Our fans had the chance to guess what each expression meant.\n\nBy linking popular discussions to Bull’s core themes, we promoted the series by actively participating in the conversations happening online."
